# Reinforcement Learning TicTacToe
TicTacToe Game with Reinforcement Learning implemented using Q-learning and Deep Q-learning.

Q-learning model has been trained while Deep Q-learning is in progress. Please run trainer.py to run the code. Other main files are solely for testing.
It will give you options including choosing the agent you want to train, whether you want to load a new model or start from scratch, and what you want to do with the model.

Currently, everything is implemented on the console but in the future we would like to implement a GUI.
